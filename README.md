# Syntactic Trees in Forest

Render LaTeX **`forest`**-style syntactic trees inline in Obsidian notes. Node labels go through Obsidian's MathJax pipeline, so primes (`X$'$`), superscripts (`X$^0$`), subscripts and arbitrary inline math just work.

The plugin focuses on the subset of `forest` that linguists actually use for syntactic trees: bracket syntax, per-node options, the `for tree` propagator, edge labels, triangle (roof) phrases, and `\draw`-style movement arrows between named nodes — with TikZ-faithful `to[…]` semantics.

---

## Usage

Trees live in fenced **`forest`** code blocks:

````markdown
```forest
[CP
  [DP, name=who [who$_i$]]
  [C$'$
    [C [did]]
    [TP
      [DP [Mary]]
      [T$'$
        [T]
        [vP
          [DP [$t$]]
          [v$'$
            [v]
            [VP
              [V [see]]
              [DP, name=obj [$t_i$]]]]]]]]]
\draw[->] (obj) to[out=south, in=south] (who);
```
````

The plugin processes the source as `forest`-package syntax and emits an inline SVG. Labels are MathJax-rendered, so anything between `$…$` typesets properly.

---

## Bracket syntax

Every node sits in `[ … ]`. Children are nested directly:

```
[Parent [Child1] [Child2 [Grandchild]]]
```

To put a literal `[`, `]`, `,`, or `=` into a label, brace-protect that chunk: `[{a, b}]`.

### Per-node options

A comma after the node content introduces a comma-separated option list:

```
[VP, draw, name=verb, tier=word]
```

|Option|Effect|
|---|---|
|`name=<id>`|Names the node so movement arrows can target it|
|`tier=<tier>`|Aligns all nodes sharing a tier name to the same horizontal line|
|`roof` / `triangle`|Draws a triangle from the parent down to this node (phrasal shorthand)|
|`draw`|Outlines the node with a rectangle|
|`circle`|Outlines the node with a circle|
|`phantom`|Reserves layout space but draws nothing — useful for alignment|
|`parent anchor=south\|center`|Where the edge leaving this node downward attaches|
|`child anchor=north\|center`|Where the edge entering this node from above attaches|
|`edge label={...}`|Italic label on the edge between this node and its parent|

### Inheritance: `for tree` and `for descendants`

Apply options to a node _and_ all its descendants:

```
[CP, for tree={parent anchor=south, child anchor=north}
  [DP] [C$'$ [C] [TP]]]
```

`for descendants={...}` does the same but excludes the node itself.

### Math in labels

Anything between `$…$` in a node label is rendered with MathJax:

|You type|You get|
|---|---|
|`X$'$`|X′|
|`X$^0$`|X⁰|
|`t$_i$`|tᵢ|
|`$\overline{X}$`|X̄|

---

## Sizing trees and nodes

Forest's TeX-dimension size options can sit on any node — root or interior — and apply locally:

|Option|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`s sep=X`|Sibling separation among **this node's children**|
|`l sep=X`|Level separation between **this node and its children**|
|`s sep+=X`|Add to the global sibling separation|
|`l sep+=X`|Add to the global level separation|
|`inner sep=X`|Padding inside each node label|
|`inner xsep=X`|Horizontal-only padding|
|`inner ysep=X`|Vertical-only padding|
|`font size=X`|Label font size|

`X` is a TeX dimension: `pt`, `pc`, `bp`, `cm`, `mm`, `em`, `ex`, `in`, `px`, or a bare number (= pixels). 1 pt ≈ 1.333 px, 1 cm ≈ 37.8 px at 96 dpi.

Local overrides on inner nodes only affect that node's children:

````markdown
```forest
[vP                              ← root spacing default
  [DP [Mary]]
  [v$'$, s sep=50pt, l sep=40pt  ← v's subtree breathes out, rest stays tight
    [v]
    [VP
      [V [saw]]
      [DP [John]]]]]
```
````

To apply to a whole subtree, use the propagator:

````markdown
```forest
[CP
  [DP]
  [C$'$
    [C]
    [TP, for tree={l sep=40pt, s sep=50pt}
      [DP] [T$'$ [T] [vP [DP] [v$'$ [v] [VP]]]]]]]
```
````
---

## Movement arrows

After the tree, you can add `\draw` commands between nodes:

```
[CP
  [DP, name=who [who$_i$]]
  [C$'$
    [C [did, name = c]]
    [TP
      [DP, name=subj [Mary$_j$]]
      [T$'$
        [T [did, name = t]]
        [vP
          [DP, name=vsubj [$t_j$]]
          [v$'$
            [V + v [see, name = v]]
            [VP
              [V [see, name = V]]
              [DP, name=obj [$t_i$]]]]]]]]]
\draw[->] (obj) to[out=west, in=west] (who);
\draw[->] (vsubj) to[out=west, in=east] (subj);
\draw[->] (t) to[out=west, in=w] (c);
\draw[->] (V) to[out=west, in=w] (v);
```


Other forms the parser recognises:

```
\draw[->] (a) to (b);
\draw[->, dashed] (a) to[bend left=45] (b);
\draw[->, dotted] (a) to node{move} (b);
\draw[->, solid] (a) -- (b);
```

Recognised within each `\draw`:

| Token         | Meaning                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\draw[-> …]` | Style block. Recognises `dashed`, `dotted`, `solid` (default is dashed) |
| `(name)`      | Reference a node by its `name=` option **or** by its content text       |
| `to[…]`       | Curved arrow with option block (see below)                              |
| `to`          | Default: drape below the tree                                           |
| `--`          | Straight line (TikZ syntax)                                             |
| `node{label}` | Italic label placed near the arrow's apex                               |

### Direction control: `to[out=A, in=B]`

Per TikZ semantics, `out=A` and `in=B` set both the **attachment point** on the node boundary AND the **tangent direction** there. The attachment is the intersection of the ray from the node's centre at angle A with the node's bounding box. So `out=south` attaches at the south boundary and the curve leaves heading south.

You can use compass names or polar angles (0°=east, 90°=north, 180°=west, 270°=south):

```
\draw[->] (a) to[out=south,      in=south]      (b);
\draw[->] (a) to[out=south west, in=south]      (b);
\draw[->] (a) to[out=east,       in=west]       (b);
\draw[->] (a) to[out=270,        in=180]        (b);
\draw[->] (a) to[out=south east, in=north west, looseness=1.4] (b);
```

Compass-name → angle: `east`=0°, `north east`=45°, `north`=90°, `north west`=135°, `west`=180°, `south west`=225°, `south`=270°, `south east`=315°.

Whitespace inside compound names is tolerated. An optional `looseness=N` (default 1) scales how strongly the tangent is enforced — higher values exaggerate the curve.

### Bend modifiers

`bend left=N` and `bend right=N` rotate the tangent angles. Combined with `out`/`in`, they add N° CCW to `out` and subtract N° from `in` (for `bend left`), bowing the curve further to that side of the path direction:

```
\draw[->] (a) to[out=south, in=east]                 (b);   ← baseline
\draw[->] (a) to[out=south, in=east, bend left=20]   (b);   ← bows more left
\draw[->] (a) to[out=south, in=east, bend right=20]  (b);   ← bows more right
```

Used alone (without `out`/`in`), `bend left=N` / `bend right=N` produce a quadratic curve bowing to that side of the direct line.

### Anchor shorthand: `(name.south)`

For simple cases you can also pin an endpoint to a named anchor directly: `(name.south)`, `(name.east)`, `(name.north west)`, etc. This is shorthand that pins the attachment point and uses the corresponding outward tangent direction. The full TikZ list is supported:

`north`, `south`, `east`, `west`, `north east`, `north west`, `south east`, `south west`, `center`.

When you give neither an anchor nor `out=/in=`, the renderer auto-picks the side of each node facing the other endpoint.

### Arrowheads

Drawn geometrically as filled triangles oriented along the curve's tangent at the endpoint — no dependence on SVG `<marker>` definitions, which makes them robust across themes and embedded-SVG quirks. Style mimics TikZ's default `>` (slim, slightly concave back).

## Settings

A settings tab exposes the global visual defaults: level separation, sibling separation, subtree separation, label font size, edge stroke width, and a toggle to outline every node by default. Per-tree options (above) override these locally.

---

## Styling

The default look is aligned with TikzJax-rendered TikZ output (Computer- Modern-style serif text, thin crisp lines, refined arrow tips). Customize further with a CSS snippet targeting any of:

|Selector|What it controls|
|---|---|
|`.forest-svg`|The root SVG. Set `font-family`, `color`, `font-size`|
|`.forest-label-wrap`|Wrapper around each node label|
|`.forest-edges`|Group containing all tree edges|
|`.forest-edge`|Each individual tree edge (line or roof)|
|`.forest-roof`|The triangle of a `roof`/`triangle` node|
|`.forest-arrows`|Group containing all movement arrows|
|`.forest-movement`|Each arrow's curve (the line, not the head)|
|`.forest-arrowhead`|The filled triangle at the arrow tip|
|`.forest-edge-label`|Italic label next to a tree edge|
|`.forest-movement-label`|Italic label near an arrow's apex|
|`.forest-node-shape`|The bounding box drawn around `draw`/`circle` nodes|

All strokes and fills resolve through `currentColor`, set from `color: var(--text-normal)` on the SVG. So one rule recolors everything:

```css
.forest-svg { color: #003366; font-family: "EB Garamond", serif; }
```

Dark mode is automatic because `--text-normal` flips with the theme.

## Installation

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css` from the release.
2. Drop them into `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-forest/`.
3. Reload plugins in Obsidian settings, then enable **Forest Syntactic Trees**.

Alternatively, to build from `source`:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

## What this plugin is _not_

It is not a complete port of the `forest` LaTeX package. `forest` is a TikZ/PGF DSL with conditionals, dynamic trees, aggregate functions, custom handlers, externalization, etc. — none of which is sensible to reimplement in JavaScript. This plugin covers the slice syntacticians reach for daily: bracket trees, primes and bars in labels, triangles, named nodes, movement arrows, and TikZ-style direction control via `out=/in=` and `bend`.
